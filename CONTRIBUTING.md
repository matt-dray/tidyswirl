Thank you for contributing to this project.

## Ways to help

You can:

* contribute a whole lesson (described in detail below)
* suggest changes to a lesson by raising [a new issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/issues)
* point out an error or bug by raising [a new issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/issues)

More generally you can help people learn by creating your own Swirl course and [contributing it to the Swirl Course Network, or you can share it via GitHub, DropBox, Google Drive, as a zip file, or as a standalone `.swc` file](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/sharing.html).

## Contribute a whole lesson

1. Install the [{swirl}]() and [{swirlify}](http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/) packages ({swirlify} was built specifically to help people make Swirl courses)
1. Create a new lesson (copy another lesson folder or run `swirlify::new_lesson()` from the folder that contains `tidyswirl/`)
1. Modify `lesson.yaml` in your lesson folder (edit by hand or use `swirlify::swirlify()` for the interactive Shiny GUI)

Leave an [issue](https://github.com/matt-dray/tidyswirl/issues) if you have any problems.
