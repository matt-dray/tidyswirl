# Swirl info reminder

- Class: text
  Output: Reminder -- you can type info() at any time to see your options. For example, 'bye()' will exit Swirl.

# Intro ---

# Single sentence purpose

- Class: text
  Output: The {tibble} package by Kirill MÃ¼ller and Hadley Wickham is a 'modern' solution to help you create, convert and handle data frames.

# Short definition/expansion

- Class: text
  Output: A data frame is a convenient format for tabular data that has observations (rows) and variables (columns). Data frame objects have the class 'data.frame' by default -- you can check this at any time with class(dataframe_name). A tibble-class data frame (or 'tbl_df') shares the benefits of data.frame, but also has some advantages.

# Tidyverse context

- Class: text
  Output: Where is {tibble} used in a tidyverse workflow? After creating a tibble, you might use {tidyr} to help make it tidy (one row per observation, one column per variable) and then {dplyr} for further manipulation.

# Install package and load it

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You first need to install {tibble} into your computer's package library. Run install.packages("tibble"), or skip() if you've installed it before.
  CorrectAnswer: if (!require("tibble")) install.packages("tibble")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('install.packages("tibble")', 'install.packages(pkgs = "tibble")', 'if (!require("tibble")) install.packages("tibble")', 'skip()')
  Hint: Remember to type quotation marks around "tibble" when you pass it to the function.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Access {tibble}'s functions by calling it from your computer's package library. Run library(tibble).
  CorrectAnswer: library(tibble)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library("tibble")', 'library(tibble)', 'library(package = "tibble")')
  Hint: Type the package name between the brackets of library(). You don't have to use quotation marks around the package name.

- Class: text
  Output: Great, the {tibble} package is installed and loaded. Now we're going to look at some of the its functions.

# Group: tibble conversion ---

- Class: text
  Output: The {tibble} package simplifies data frames in R. Let's take a look at an example. The 'airquality' dataset is built into R and is of class 'data.frame'. Let's compare the output from 'airquality' when it has the class data.frame and the class tibble.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First, pass 'airquality' to the class() function to see what class of object it is.
  CorrectAnswer: class(airquality)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'class(airquality')
  Hint: Type 'airquality' (without quote marks) inside the brackets of class() and then hit enter.

- Class: text
  Output: So the airquality object is of the 'data.frame' class, the basic tabular format used in R.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now run 'airquality' to see an example of the typical output from an object with class data.frame.
  CorrectAnswer: airquality
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('print(airquality)', 'airquality')
  Hint: Type 'airquality' (without quote marks) and hit enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Calling the airquality data.frame object resulted in R printing all 153 of its rows, which flooded the console.

# Function: as_tibble()

- Class: text
  Output: What can we do to make this output more user-friendly? We can change it to a tibble-class object (a tbl_df) using the as_tibble() function. What does a tibble output look like?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use as_tibble() to convert the airquality data frame from the data.frame class to the tibble class. Assign it (<-) to the name 'airquality_tbl'.
  CorrectAnswer: airquality_tbl <- as_tibble(airquality)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('airquality_tbl <- as_tibble(airquality)', 'airquality_tbl <- as_tibble(x = airquality)')
  Hint: Use the form 'object_name <- as_tibble(dataframe_name)', where the object is called airquality_tbla and the data frame is called airquality.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Before we look at the output, let's check the class of this new object. Type class(airquality_tbl) and observe the output. 
  CorrectAnswer: class(airquality_tbl)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='class(airquality_tbl)')
  Hint: Type 'class(airquality_tbl)' (without the quotes) and hit enter.

- Class: text
  Output: Aha, so it actually has three classes. It retains the data.frame class so you can work with it as though it were a data.frame, but it also takes the tibble classes of tbl_df and tbl (for now, don't worry that there are two separate tibble classes). 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Okey-dokey, so what does a tibble output look like? Type airquality_tbl and observe the output. 
  CorrectAnswer: airquality_tbl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='airquality_tbl')
  Hint: Type 'airquality_tbl' (without the quotes) and hit enter.

# Group test

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Compare the data.frame output to the tibble output. Which of the following is true?
  AnswerChoices: Tibbles print fewer rows by default; Tibbles use colour to provide meaning; Tibbles give the data type of each column; All of these are true
  CorrectAnswer: All of these are true
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='All of these are true')
  Hint: Take a look at the tibble that was printed after you executed as_tibble(airquality)

- Class: text
  Output: When printed, tibbles limit the output to 10 rows and report the number of rows omitted. Tibble outputs also report the dimensions (153 rows by 6 columns) and column types (like <int> for integers). Colour is also used to differentiate data from metadata, while missing values (NA) are highlighted in red as a warning (as are negative values).

# Group: tibble creation ---

# Function: tibble()

- Class: text
  Output: You can create tibbles from scratch; you don't just have to convert to them from objects with the data.frame class. There are two functions for this, which are tibble() and tribble().

- Class: text
  Output: Let's create a very simple tibble object using the tibble() function. Within the function you provide column names and assign vectors to them using c(). The first vector element will be in the first row, and so on. For example, tibble(col1 = c(1:2), col2 = c("a", "b")) creates a two-column, two-row data frame where the first row has a 1 in the column 'col1' and "a" in the column 'col2'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a tibble() with two columns ("animal" and "legs") and three rows (one each for "cat", "snake" and "bird" and their typical leg count). Assign ('<-') the name 'legs_tbl'.
  CorrectAnswer: legs_tbl <- tibble(animal = c("cat", "snake", "bird"), legs = c(4, 0, 2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='legs_tbl <- tibble(animal = c("cat", "snake", "bird"), legs = c(4, 0, 2))')
  Hint: Write your answer in the form 'object_name <- tibble(col1 = c(1:2), col2 = c("a", "b"))'

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now print the tibble by calling 'legs_tbl'.
  CorrectAnswer: legs_tbl
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='legs_tbl')
  Hint: Type the object name 'legs_tbl' (without quotes) and press enter to print it.

- Class: text
  Output: So you can see that tibble() lets us build a data frame column by column. First you specified the 'animals' column, then the 'legs' column.

# Function: tribble()

- Class: text
  Output: You can also construct a tibble object row-by-row by using the tribble() function (think of the 'r' in 'tribble' as meaning 'rows'). This can be handy for copy-pasting the contents of an external table into R.

- Class: text
  Output: The expression tribble(~number, ~letter, 1, "a", 2, "b") produces a two-row two-column data frame. See how we're supplying each row at a time? The first two are the headers, denoted with a '~' (tilde), followed by the first row of data (1 and "a") and so on. You could break each of these row specifications onto a new line in your script file to make it easier to read.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the tribble() function to recreate your earlier tibble. The column headers should be 'animal' and 'legs' with rows for 'cat', 'snake' and 'spider'.
  CorrectAnswer: tribble(~animal, ~legs, "cat", 4, "snake", 0, "bird", 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tribble(~animal, ~legs, "cat", 4, "snake", 0, "bird", 2)')
  Hint: Remember to prefix the column headers with a '~' (tilde). The headers don't have to be surrounded with quote marks.

- Class: text
  Output: So we got the same outputs from both the tibble() and tribble().

# Function: enframe()

- Class: text
  Output: The tidyverse emphasises the use of tidy data frames, where each row represents a single observation. As such, many tidyverse tools operate on 'two-dimensional' (tabular) data rather than 'one-dimensional' (vector) data. How can we 'frame' our vector to a tibble so it's ready for data manipulation with the tidyverse?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Remember the 'legs_vec' object we created earlier? Type its name to print it.
  CorrectAnswer: legs_vec
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('print(legs_vec)', 'legs_vec')
  Hint: Type 'legs_vec' (without quotes) and hit enter to print the object.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Supply legs_vec to the enframe() function and observe the output. 
  CorrectAnswer: enframe(legs_vec)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='enframe(legs_vec)')
  Hint: Type enframe() with the object's name between the brackets.
  
- Class: text
  Output: Great, you turned legs_vec from a character vector to a tibble. Note that you can 'undo' this process by using deframe() to go from the data frame to the vector.

# Group: augment tibbles ---

- Class: text
  Output: Once you've created a tibble, you can add new data with add_row() and add_column(). We'll practice using a tibble called 'legs_tbl' that I've added to your workspace (it's the same data as you created in the tibble() and tribble() examples).

# Function: add_row()

- Class: text
  Output: You can use add_row() by supplying the name of the dataframe and then the value you'd like to add to each column along the new row, in the form add_row(dataframe_name, col1 = "a", col2 = 1)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add a row to the legs_tbl tibble for 'spider' and its number of legs.
  CorrectAnswer: add_row(legs_tbl, animal = "spider", legs = 8)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='add_row(legs_tbl, animal = "spider", legs = 8)')
  Hint: In the add_row() function you need to supply the tibble name (legs_tbl) and values for the 'animal' and 'legs' columns.

- Class: text
  Output: Great, see how the new data has been added as a row to the bottom of the original tibble?

# Function: add_column()

- Class: text
  Output: You can declare new columns with add_column() in the same way you did for tibble(). To the add_column function you supply an expression in the form 'new_col = c("a", "b", "c")'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add a column to the legs_tbl tibble called 'wings' and use c() to supply a vector of the number of wings each animal has. Remember that the animals in this tibble are cat, snake and bird.
  CorrectAnswer: add_column(df, wings = c(0, 0, 2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='add_column(df, wings = c(0, 0, 2))')
  Hint: In the add_column() function you need to supply the tibble name (legs_tbl) first, followed by the new column name with a vector of values (i.e. 'wings = c(0, 0, 2)').

- Class: text
  Output: Great, see how the new data has been added as a column to the right of the rows in the original tibble?

# Outro: what have we learnt?

- Class: text
  Output: So what did we learn in this lesson? We've seen how to (1) convert data.frame-class objects to tibble-class objects with as_tibble(), (2) create tibbles with tibble(), tribble() and enframe(), and (3) and expanded a tibble with add_column() and add_row().
