# Intro ---

# Single sentence purpose

- Class: text
  Output: The {tibble} package helps you create, convert and handle data frames.

# Short definition/expansion

- Class: text
  Output: A data frame is a convenient format for tabular data that has observations (rows) and variables (columns). Data frame objects have the class 'data.frame' by default -- you can check this at any time with class(dataframe_name). A tibble-class data frame (or 'tbl_df') shares the benefits of data.frame, but also has some advantages.

# Tidyverse context

- Class: text
  Output: Where is {tibble} used in a tidyverse workflow? After creating a tibble, you might use {tidyr} to help make it tidy (one row per observation, one column per variable) and then {dplyr} for further manipulation.

# Install package and load it

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You first need to install {tibble} into your computer's package library. Run install.packages("tibble"), or skip() if you've installed it before.
  CorrectAnswer: if (!require("tibble")) install.packages("tibble")
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('install.packages("tibble")', 'install.packages(pkgs = "tibble")', 'if (!require("tibble")) install.packages("tibble")', 'skip()')
  Hint: Remember to type quotation marks around "tibble" when you pass it to the function.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Access {tibble}'s functions by calling it from your computer's package library. Run library(tibble).
  CorrectAnswer: library(tibble)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('library("tibble")', 'library(tibble)', 'library(package = "tibble")')
  Hint: Type the package name between the brackets of library(). You don't have to use quotation marks around the package name.

- Class: text
  Output: Great, the {tibble} package is installed and loaded. Now we're going to look at some of the its functions.

# Group: tibble conversion

- Class: text
  Output: The {tibble} package simplifies data frames in R. Let's take a look at an example. The 'airquality' dataset is built into R and is of class 'data.frame'. Let's compare the output from 'airquality' when it has the class data.frame and the class tibble.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Run 'airquality' to see an example of the typical output from an object with class data.frame.
  CorrectAnswer: airquality
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('print(airquality)', 'airquality')
  Hint: Type 'airquality' (without quote marks) at the prompt.

- Class: text
  Output: Calling the airquality data.frame object resulted in R printing all 153 of its rows, which flooded the console.

# Function: as_tibble()

- Class: text
  Output: What can we do to make this output more user-friendly? We can change it to a tibble-class object (a tbl_df) using the as_tibble() function. What does a tibble output look like?
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use as_tibble() to convert the airquality data frame from the data.frame class to the tibble class.
  CorrectAnswer: as_tibble(airquality)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('as_tibble(airquality)', 'as_tibble(x = airquality)')
  Hint: Type as_tibble() with 'airquality' (without quotation marks) between the brackets.

# Group test

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Compare the data.frame output to the tibble output. Which of the following is true?
  AnswerChoices: Tibbles print fewer rows; Tibbles use colour to provide meaning; Tibbles give the data type of each column; All of these are true
  CorrectAnswer: All of these are true
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='All of these are true')
  Hint: Take a look at the tibble that was printed after you executed as_tibble(airquality)

- Class: text
  Output: When printed, tibbles limit the output to 10 rows and report the number of rows omitted. Tibble outputs also report the dimensions (153 rows by 6 columns) and column types (like <int> for integers). Colour is also used to differentiate data from metadata, while missing values (NA) are highlighted in red as a warning (as are negative values).

# Group: tibble creation

# Function: tibble()

- Class: text
  Output: You can create tibbles from scratch; you don't just have to convert to them from objects with the data.frame class. There are two functions for this, which are tibble() and tribble().

- Class: text
  Output: Let's create a very simple tibble object using the tibble() function. Within the function you provide column names and assign vectors to them using c(). The first vector element will be in the first row, and so on. For example, tibble(col1 = c(1:2), col2 = c("a", "b")) creates a two-column, two-row data frame where the first row has a 1 in the column 'col1' and "a" in the column 'col2'.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a tibble() with two columns ("animal" and "legs") and three rows (one each for "cat", "snake", "bird" and the typical number of legs they have).
  CorrectAnswer: tibble(animal = c("cat", "snake", "bird"), leg_count = c(4, 0, 2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tibble(animal = c("cat", "snake", "bird"), legs = c(4, 0, 2))')
  Hint: Write your answer in the form tibble(col1 = c(1:2), col2 = c("a", "b"))

- Class: text
  Output: So tibble() lets us build a data frame column by column. First you specified the 'animals' column, then the 'legs' column.

# Function: tribble()

- Class: text
  Output: You can also construct a tibble object row-by-row by using the tribble() function (the 'r' in 'tribble' stands for 'rows', probably). This makes it easy to copy-paste the contents of some external table into R and make it into a data frame with only small changes.

- Class: text
  Output: The line tribble(~col1, ~col2, 1, "a", 2, "b") produces the same two-row two-column example we saw in the tibble() example earlier. See how we're supplying each row at a time? The first two are the headers, denoted with a '~' (tilde), followed by the first row of data (1 and "a") and so on. You could break each of these row specifications onto a new line in your script file to make it easier to read.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the tribble() function to recreate your earlier tibble. The column headers should be 'animal' and 'legs' with rows for 'cat', 'snake' and 'spider'.
  CorrectAnswer: tribble(~animal, ~legs, "cat", 4, "snake", 0, "bird", 2)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='tribble(~animal, ~legs, "cat", 4, "snake", 0, "bird", 2)')
  Hint: Remember to prefix the column headers with a '~' (tilde). The headers don't have to be surrounded with quote marks.

- Class: text
  Output: So we got the same outputs from both the tibble() and tribble().

# Function: enframe()

- Class: text
  Output: The tidyverse emphasises the use of tidy data frames, where each row represents a single observation. As such, many tidyverse tools operate on 'two-dimensional' (tabular) data rather than 'one-dimensional' (vector) data. How can we 'frame' our vector to a tibble so it's ready for data manipulation with the tidyverse?

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: I've added a named character vector called 'legs_vec' to your environment. Now print it.
  CorrectAnswer: legs_vec
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('print(legs_vec)', 'legs_vec')
  Hint: Simply type the object's name to print it.
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Use the enframe() function on this object and observe the output. 
  CorrectAnswer: enframe(legs_vec)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='legs_vec')
  Hint: Type enframe() with the object's name between the brackets.
  
- Class: text
  Output: You started with a character vector, a 'data sequence' of values, and ended up with a data frame. Now it's ready for manipulation with other tidyverse packages like {dplyr}. Note that you can 'undo' this process by using deframe() to go from the data frame to the vector.

# Group: augment tibbles

- Class: text
  Output: Once you've created a tibble, you can add new data with add_row() and add_column(). We'll practice using a tibble called 'df' that I've added to your workspace (it's the same data as you created in the tibble() and tribble() examples).

# Function: add_row()

- Class: text
  Output: You can use add_row() by supplying the name of the dataframe and then the value you'd like to add to each column along the new row, in the form add_row(dataframe_name, col1 = "a", col2 = 1)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add a row to the df tibble for 'spider' and its number of legs.
  CorrectAnswer: add_row(df, animal = "spider", legs = 8)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='add_row(df, animal = "spider", legs = 8)')
  Hint: In the add_row() function you need to supply the tibble name (df) and values for the 'animal' and 'legs' columns.

- Class: text
  Output: See how 

# Function: add_column()

- Class: text
  Output: You declare new columns with add_column() in the same way you did for tibble(), using the form 'new_col = c("a", "b", "c")' inside the function.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add a column to the df tibble called 'wings' and use c() to supply a vector of the number of wings each animal has.
  CorrectAnswer: add_column(df, wings = c(0, 0, 2))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='add_column(df, wings = c(0, 0, 2))')
  Hint: In the add_column() function you need to supply the tibble name (df) first and then values for the new 'wings' column with c().

# Outro: what have we learnt?

- Class: text
  Output: We've seen how to (1) convert data.frame-class objects to tibble-class objects with as_tibble(), (2) create tibbles with tibble(), tribble() and enframe(), and (3) and expanded a tibble with add_column() and add_row().
